      <li>Our team, at its peak this year, won a Think Award and got 3rd place for Inspire. We were super close to making states!</li>
      <li>I am a massive Microsoft fan. I have been using their software since the first time I have touched a computer. I think a lot of people assume they have trashy software because they've been using Windows XP/Windows Server 2007 software and Chromebooks in school, but the modern versions of these are epic. You think you've seen all my shenanigans Mr. Brady, sir you are wrong! I have an account on Microsoft Rewards which gives me money every time I search. I have made $8 in the past month! Plus, I know lots of optimization and efficiency strategies that have been making me a better Windows user. Mannan says I technically can't consider myself an avid Windows user because I haven't done much with the registry and PowerShell. I believe that utilizing every aspect of what Windows has to offer is more important than knowing how it works, for now.</li>
      <li>Some software which I use (and are epic) are VS Code, WebStorm, Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Word (when I can), IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, and Android Studio.</li>
