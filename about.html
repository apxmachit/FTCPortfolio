<p class="text">Hello! My name is Nicholas Walls (Nick). I am in the class of 2022 at Robbinsville High School. I am also on the First Tech Challenge team 14020 Nemesis Prime. I joined because I loved the ideas behind FIRST and am interested into STEM fields (particularly Computer Science). I have learned how to use Java to program robots and solve problems. I also learned how to interpret code from others, improve code, code efficiently with usage of IDEs, code under pressure, code as a team, and so much more. I continue to use my knowledge inside and outside of robotics to my advantage. I like biking, swimming, playing video games, and coding. I'm not sure what exactly I would like to persue in Computer Science but this experience has certainly pushed me further towards my goals.</p>
