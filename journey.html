      My first dip into this year was making a kit-bot for the tryouts process. It was my first time working with super small parts like this and it drove me crazy! It was tough but fostered essential building skills for later on.

      Here is where those "essential building skills" come into play. I was tasked to brainstorm an intake system, design a prototype robot (with wood) and (with Jeremy) create a proof of concept elevator design. We moved away from them eventually but the prototype was part of the process to making our extendable arm!

      Finally, I hear you say. The coding parts! My first challenges were making the kit-bots run through a maze and testing a servo motor for our robot. This code snippet causes the servo to move 90 degrees regardless of where the servo starts. This was useful for our original servo elevator design and now for our team marker deployment.

    I also was the head of the software Vuforia which we would use to examine the navigation targets on the field to determine our robot's position and orientation. We would calculate the differences between each distance/angle we find and the distances/angles we need to reach our destinations, and drive along them.

    During our competitions, my three main things were scouting, judging, and repairing our robot in between each match. In order to be successful, we needed to fix any problems our robot ran into, present our progress well to the judges so they can give us awards, and get data to calculate which teams should be part of our alliance if we become an alliance captain.

    My first time working with kids was Discovery Day. I don't have pictures of myself there so I put some examples of what I did. In the morning (12/1) I worked with two other kids to create a robot out of Lego Mindstorms materials which competed to climb a ramp and play Tug of War. At the end our robot went 2-0 in Tug of War and was able to climb the ramp at a maximum of a 45-degree angle. I am still so proud of my kids!

    We will end off with Sponsor Night. Ryan kicked off the night with an introduction and then I presented my freshman perspective speech to our sponsors. I split off to guide a group around our team's various stations and we ended it off with a nice dinner. Above, you can watch the video of my speech!

    This year I learned a lot about the design process, code languages, and applications I can use to support my growth in Computer Science. Outreach pushed me out of my comfort zone to formally present and converse with judges and sponsors. It was a great year, and I am super excited for my future in high school robotics. Special thanks to Mr. Brady, Mr. Young, Mrs. Young, Mrs. Vast, Mr. Keller, Mr. Huang and everyone else who supported me.
